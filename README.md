# 2D Code Reader

The simplest line and matrix codes reader out there. Scans all major and most popular 2D codes. **One app to scan them all**.

## Tests

Tested on four different devices and Android versions:

- Samsung Galaxy Nexus with Android 4.3 (previously Android 4.2.2),
- LG GT540 with Android 2.3.3 and CyanogenMod, 
- GSmart Rola G1317D with Android 2.2.2,
- Sony Xperia E with Android 4.1.1.

All seems to be fine. I haven't got any chance testing it on either iOS or Windows Mobile so far. Sorry. Tested **only** as compiled through [PhoneGap Build](http://build.phonegap.com). Never compiled locally or tested after such build.

Initially based on [wildabeast/BarcodeDemo](https://github.com/wildabeast/BarcodeDemo) repository, a demo for [BarcodeScanner plugin](https://github.com/wildabeast/BarcodeScanner) for PhoneGap Build. With a lot of changes since then.
